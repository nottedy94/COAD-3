 title={Plant Animal Interactions: An Evolutionary Approach}, ISBN={978-1-4443-1229-4}, abstractNote={Interactions between plants and animals are incredibly diverse and complex and span terrestrial, atmospheric and aquatic environments. The last decade has seen the emergence of a vast quantity of data on the subject and there is now a perceived need among both teachers and undergraduate students for a new textbook that incorporates the numerous recent advances made in the field. The book is intended for use by advanced level undergraduate and beginning graduate students, taking related courses in wider ecology degree programmes.   Very few books cover this subject and those that do are out of date.}, note={Google-Books-ID: u4jAB7_7srsC}, publisher={John Wiley & Sons}, author={Herrera, Carlos M. and Pellmyr, Olle}, year={2009}, month={Apr}, language={en} }
